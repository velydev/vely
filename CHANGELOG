Vely release notes for 17.1.0

- Notes: Major addition in this release is the semantic and self-documenting implementation of tasks and subtasks within requests, which allows for more readable and cleaner application architecture. In addition, C/C++ comments are now properly parsed. Another notable improvement is the color-highlighting of diagnostic messages, which also includes both Vely and C code text (generated or otherwise), with exact placement of error; this makes developing with Vely easier.
- Minor: added semantic support for tasks under requests; see if-task and task-param.
- Minor: added support for C and C++ comments.
- Minor: added max-errors for the number of diagnostic messages.
- Release: added Application Architecture documentation article.
- Release: removed metadata expiration default for Fedora packages.
- Release: added color highlighting for Vely diagnostics, as well as the text of Vely source code and C code lines in the output. More precise diagnostic messages. Also added --plain-diag to use old diagnostic style.
- Release: maximum URL path is now 2500 bytes.
- Release: fixed bug where set-input would crash with unmanaged memory.
