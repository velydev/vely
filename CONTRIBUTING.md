# Open Source, not open-contribution

Vely is [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd/), but it is not open to contributions.

The decision to keep this project closed to contributions was made for the long term viability of the project in order to keep it focused and spend less time and energy on managing contributions, and more on bug fixes and features. This is true especially when the PR's author is no longer willing or able to help with maintenance.

It is true that a project can ultimately benefit from opening to contribution. On the other hand, due to complexity and stress for the maintainer, it may also get it killed. I do not believe any Open Source project should be judged either way in this regard, as it is a fair choice for anyone.

Another aspect here is the Contributor License Agreement(s) related to the legal side of maintaining contributions and resolving any issues. Recent switch from LGPL-3 to a more business-friendly EPL-2 open source license would have been much harder and longer without either owning the copyright or maintaining CLAs properly, a job well suited to companies with more resources.

You can support Vely project by spreading the word about it, reporting bugs and suggesting improvements and new features, which are welcome and appreciated.

The method available to submit bug reports or suggesting new features is via email. As the project is not open to contributions, much of the issue tracking functionality related to PRs and communication between outside contributors isn't necessary, and there's less efforts to spend maintaining and moderating it. Please go [here](https://vely.dev/bugs_enhancements_feedback.html) to send bug or feature requests.

Along with these, "Fork" functionality is disabled too, as it doesn't make much sense without PRs. You can of course, Clone the project any time you like.

The intent of this contribution policy is not to come across as anything but grateful to the community, and I hope it will be taken in such a way.
