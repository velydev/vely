p-out <string>

.EE
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
p-out outputs a string expression given by <string>, without any encoding (meaning a string is output exactly as it appears). The string is sent to a client that made the request. If this is within \fBwrite-string\fP, then <string> is output into the buffer that builds a new string.

.SH EXAMPLES
To output data verbatim to a client:

.RS 4
.EX

char *mydata="Hello world";
p-out mydata

.EE
.RE

Writing to client, outputting text followed by a horizontal rule - the text is output to a client (such as browser) as it is, and the browser will interpret tags "<br/>" and "<hr/>" as a line break and a horizonal line and display them as such:

.RS 4
.EX

p-out "This is a non-encoded output<br/>"
p-out "<hr/>"

.EE
.RE

Create a query text string by means of \fBwrite-string\fP statement:

.RS 4
.EX

void get_table_data (const char *table_name)
{
   //
   // Construct the run-time text of dynamic SQL
   //
   write-string define qry_txt
   @select * from <<p-out table_name>>
   end-write-string
}
